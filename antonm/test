INSERT INTO articles VALUES(5,'Hiking in Bear Country? How to Prevent an Attack','News of a grizzly bear attacking a 63-year-old man, who was a skilled hiker, in Yellowstone on Friday (Aug. 7), may have even avid adventurers wondering what''s the best way to escape the long and curved claws of such a wild animal.

The experts have tips for how to come out on top after a face to face with a towering bear.

It''s unclear how Lance Crosby, who had worked five seasons with Medcor, a company that runs three urgent-care clinics in the park, died. "But the preliminary results show that he was attacked by at least one grizzly bear," according to a National Park Service (NPS) statement. "His body was found partially consumed and cached, or covered, and partial tracks at the scene indicate that an adult female grizzly and at least one cub-of-the-year were present and likely involved in the attack.

Officials at Yellowstone National Park set a bear trap and have captured one female grizzly and her two cubs. They''re testing her scat samples, DNA and paw print size to determine whether she''s the same bear that attacked Crosby and partially consumed his body, the NPS said. If there''s a match, the bear will be euthanized, the NPS reported.

The grizzly''s cubs will not be able to survive without it, said Yellowstone spokeswoman Amy Bartlett.  Unless officials can find a home for them at a zoo or an accredited wildlife organization, they will also be euthanized, she told Live Science.

"Fortunately, these kind of incidents don’t happen that often," Yellowstone spokeswoman Julena Campbell told the Washington Post. "There''s not a lot of evidence to show that it is necessarily a learned behavior, but it can be. We know they are creatures of habit and that bears get habituated pretty quickly when they learn something is a food source."

Though frightening, bear attacks are extremely rare. From 1980 to 2011, more than 90 million people visited Yellowstone. During that time, bears injured 43 people in the park, the NPS reported. Of those, 32 injuries were caused by grizzlies in the backcountry, leading to an average of about one grizzly-related attack a year.

From 1872 to 2011, bears of any species have killed a total of seven people in Yellowstone, the NPS said.

Bear attacks

The NPS offered several ways to prevent bear attacks. First off, be aware of signs that bears may be nearby. Hikers can look for fresh tracks or scat, as well as feeding sites, which include diggings, torn-up logs and ripped-open anthills. Avoid carcasses and don''t leave lunchboxes unattended, as a bear may find the food first.

During the summer, bears are most active during the cooler hours during dawn, dusk and nighttime. Try to avoid hiking during these times when going into bear country, the NPS said.

Once the hike is underway, periodically yell, "Hey bear" to alert animals that there are humans nearby, which will give them time to leave the area. In Yellowstone, bears spend seven months fattening up for their five months of hibernation. A feeding bear might not notice people right away, and it''s best not to startle them, the NPS said.  

If a bear doesn''t notice a hiker, the person still has time to get away. "Keep out of sight and detour as far as possible behind and downwind of the bear," the NPS said. "If the bear sees you, retreat slowly and leave the area."

Under no circumstances should a person run away or try to climb a tree. Both can provoke a bear to give chase, and they''re fast animals and expert tree climbers, according to the NPS. [Cuddly But Powerful: See Photos of the World''s Bears]

Safety in loudness and numbers can also help, according to the NPS. Since 1970, 91 percent of people injured by bears were hiking alone or with one partner, and just 9 percent of those hurt by bears were in groups of three or more people, the NPS reported.

Charging bears

If a bear sees and charges at a hiker, it''s best to stay still and "stand your ground," the NPS said. 

"Most of the time, if you do this, the bear is likely to break off the charge or veer away," the NPS said. "This is called a bluff charge."

If the bear gets within 40 feet (12 meters), start spraying pepper or bear spray. Both contain capsaicin, a chemical that irritates the bear''s eyes, nose, mouth, throat and lungs. But, if the bear continues to charge, it''s time to play dead, the NPS said.

Timing is incredibly important. A bear can still veer off at the last moment, so a person should play dead only within a nanosecond of making contact with the bear.

"Drop to the ground; keep your pack on to protect your back," the NPS said. "Lie on your stomach, face down, and clasp your hands over the back of your neck with your elbows protecting the sides of your face. Remain still and stay silent to convince the bear that you are not a threat to it or its cubs."

Once the bear leaves, wait several minutes to make sure the bear and its cubs are no longer nearby. Then, cautiously get up and walk (don''t run) away, the NPS said. The bear could still attack again.

If a bear does attack, don''t fight back. Fighting will only prolong the attack, and will likely result in more severe injuries, the NPS said. Since 1970, people who encountered bears in Yellowstone and played dead received minor injuries 75 percent of the time. People who fought back received very serious injuries 80 percent of the time, the park reported.

As of 2014, between 674 and 839 grizzly bears have been spotted living in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the NPS reported.

Predatory bears

The only time to pull a Rambo move is if a predatory bear — instead of a defensive bear protecting itself, its food or its cubs — is attacking. Predatory bear attacks are rare (they''re less than one-half of 1 percent of all bear attacks, Bartlett said), but usually aren''t preceded by warning signals, such as huffing or ground slapping, and the bear "will keep bearing in on you," the NPS said.

"During a predatory attack, you should be aggressive and fight back using any available weapon (bear spray, rocks, sticks) to stop the aggression by the bear," the NPS said. "Fight back as if your life depends on it, because it does. Predatory attacks usually persist until the bear is scared away, overpowered, injured or killed."

So, what''s the take-away message?

"Play dead if a defensive bear makes contact," the NPS said. "Always fight back against a predatory bear."','','2015-08-12 16:01:37.205605','2015-08-12 16:04:47.052963');
INSERT INTO articles VALUES(6,'Sea Lion ''Aerospace'': High-Thrust, Low Wake','his article was originally published on The Conversation. The publication contributed this article to Live Science''s Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.

The California sea lion has a unique way of moving through the ocean. This highly maneuverable aquatic mammal produces thrust primarily with its foreflippers – the ones it has where you have hands. Despite being fast, efficient and agile, this sea lion swimming technique is quite different from the way other large fish and marine mammals move through the water.

It wouldn’t be easy to design a system from scratch that could match the sea lion’s specifications – they produce high levels of thrust while leaving little traceable wake structure. So it makes sense to learn as much as we can about how they do it – with the thought that someday we might be able to engineer something that mimics our biological model.

o understand sea lion hydrodynamics – that is, the physics of how their swimming motion disrupts the surrounding water – we have to first characterize the kinematics – how their bodies move. And to do that we need to observe lots of California sea lion movements. So we head to the zoo.

“Field” work close to home
Typically, fieldwork is hard, time-consuming and expensive. But because our “field” is only two miles away from our lab, and because the American Trail staff at the Smithsonian National Zoo is so accommodating, for us it is only hard and time-consuming.

We are able to return time and again to try new techniques and collect more data as needed. To avoid crowds but still get adequate lighting for our cameras, we arrive at 7:30 am to set up and begin taking data.

Our data are high-resolution, high-speed videos. We set up cameras in precise, known locations and place small calibration markers on the viewing window. Multiple cameras are synced using a flash or audio marker – and then we wait.

While this is an “observational” study – we do not mark or touch the animals while obtaining data – the sea lions prefer to play rather than just be observed. So we’ll wave and run back and forth across the viewing window (a great job for undergrad research interns) to entice them to exhibit the behavior we hope to capture. What we really want to see is the sea lion’s propulsive stroke – where they clap their foreflippers toward their belly and glide forward.

So far, in just under two years of collecting data, we have amassed over 100 hours of footage of sea lions swimming, about 30 minutes of which is usable data.

Back in the lab

The vast majority of our time is spent not at the zoo with the animals, but with our videos of their movements.

Learning something from the data we collect takes time, patience and computers. Of course video is only a two-dimensional representation of what really happened in space. So we convert all our video through a process called digital linear transformation, a method used to track three-dimensional motion that was developed by Ty Hedrick of UNC to track hummingbird and hawk moth flying.

Individual points on a sea lion’s flipper are digitally located in each frame of the video (120 frames per second). Those locations are tracked from frame to frame, creating a surface that represents the motion of the sea lion’s foreflipper while swimming.

Through this process, we can create a digital foreflipper that can be programmed to move like a real swimming California sea lion.

So how do they actually move?

The California sea lion relies predominantly on its foreflippers for thrust production. Thrust is the force that accelerates the animal in the forward direction. The large flippers move through the water in a clapping motion that ends with each flipper pressed against the animal’s torso.

This flipper-based motion differs significantly from other large fish and marine mammals, which typically have a dominant oscillation frequency. For fish, that means they flap their tails side to side continually. Aquatic mammals flap up and down. In both, every flap takes about the same amount of time. Instead, in sea lions, each clap of the flipper is followed by a prolonged glide — particularly unusual for large, high-thrust-producing swimmers. The smooth swim is assisted by the animal’s low drag coefficient, meaning it glides through the water easily without much resistance slowing it down.

Our observational work so far has led to a detailed two-dimensional description of sea lion swimming, and we are currently working to track the flipper in three dimensions.

Creating a robo-foreflipper

My background, and the focus of my lab, is fluid dynamics, but so far our sea lion studies have been kinematic studies. Ultimately, we want to know how the water around the sea lion reacts to the what we’re learning about how their bodies move. To do that, we are using all the data we’ve collected from the field studies to create a robotic sea lion foreflipper.

The flipper geometry is based on high-resolution laser scans of a real California sea lion foreflipper. We program its motion based on the results of our field studies.

By creating a robotic platform, we have a controllable, scalable device that can be used in the lab. We want to measure how the water reacts to the sea lion flipper, something that’s very hard to figure out using live sea lions, mostly due to their size and the need for highly specialized equipment.

Now with our robo-foreflipper, we can investigate, and hopefully understand, the unique way that sea lions move the water while performing their one-of-a-kind swimming motion. Eventually we might see this technique incorporated into an engineered underwater vehicle that could be used to search for underwater mines, or shipwrecks, or unexplored caves – anything that requires stealth, agility and speed in the water.

INSERT INTO articles VALUES(7,'5 Ways Cecil the Lion Helped Scientists Understand Big Cats','When an American big-game hunter shot and killed a famous lion named Cecil in Zimbabwe last month, he did more than kill an animal — he killed an important research subject.

Cecil, a 13-year-old male Southwest African lion, had been part of an ecological study in Zimbabwe''s Hwange National Park since 2008. The initiative was developed by researchers at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, and is one of several conservation projects managed by the university''s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU).

In recent weeks, the WildCRU researchers who had been studying Cecil from the time the big cat was 5 years old have given a number of interviews and posted a wealth of information on the WildCRU website to explain what they learned from Cecil before his death. Here are five ways Cecil and the other lions involved in the study have helped science. 

1. Deeply perturbed

The death of Cecil will likely result in the death of several more lionsbecause of what WildCRU researchers call the "perturbation effect." When the male leader of a pride is killed, other, nonrelated males typically vie for the newly available top spot. If the leader had brothers, the new coalition will kill them. If the leader left behind cubs, rival males will kill them as well, according to researchers.

WildCRU scientists plan to closely observe the ramifications of Cecil''s death within the lion''s former pride, according to a recent post on the group''s website. David Macdonald, WildCRU''s co-founder and director, called Cecil''s death "heartbreaking" but said the organization''s goal is to learn from this event in the coming weeks.

2. Total "bros"

Lion brothers have complex, intimate relationships. When Cecil was first fitted with a GPS collar in 2008, he was traveling around Hwange National Parkwith his brother, searching for a pride of females that they might claim as their own. This behavior, known as "dispersing," is typical for young male lions and usually results in a big fight between the young males and the lions that are leading whatever pack the youngsters try to take over, Macdonald explained in his recent post.

Cecil and his brother took over their first pride in 2008, but they didn''t hold it for long. In 2009, an aggressive neighboring pride challenged the brothers'' rule, and Cecil''s brother was killed in what Macdonald called a "border skirmish."

3. Turn the other cheek

The pride that had wrested power away from Cecil and his brother were known as the "Askari" coalition, and when Cecil''s brother died, so did the leader of the Askari — another GPS-collared lion named Mpofu. But Mpofu left behind three sons who continued to rule the pride after their father''s death.

One of Mpofu''s sons, Jericho, was later ousted from the pride after trophy hunters killed both of his brothers. Things were looking pretty grim for Jericho until he met up with his former enemy, Cecil, who had also just been kicked out of the pride he had controlled for several years. Though the two got off to a rocky start, they later became inseparable, Macdonald said.

Unrelated male lions often form brotherly bonds because holding onto a pride, and the territory that comes with it, is just too much work for one lion, according to Macdonald, who said it also "makes sense" for unrelated males to team up in order to "gain access to a pride."

4. Always on the go

Lions tend to call a giant swath of wilderness home. In Hwange National Park, GPS-collared lions have been known to inhabit "home ranges" (the areas in which an animal lives and travels) covering more than 116 square miles (300 square kilometers), according to Andrew Loveridge, a longtime researcher with WildCRU''s Hwange ecology project.

In a 2012 interview with the writers of Oxford''s science blog (which was recently republished online), Loveridge said lions'' wide "ranging" behavior and their ability to traverse many kinds of terrain are both surprising and intriguing. [Photos: The Wild Cats of Kruger National Park]

WildCRU researchers once observed a 10-year-old male lion (Loveridge didn''t specify whether it was Cecil) move from Hwange National Park to a town in Zambia — a 137-mile (220 km) journey that took the lion about a month to complete. On its way, the lion crossed a river that was more than 300 feet (100 meters) wide, navigating through white-water rapids to get across. Understanding how lions move is essential to protecting these creatures from contentious encounters with humans, Loveridge said.

5. Super-responsive

Lions are good at going with the flow, according to Loveridge, who said that the Hwange study has revealed one particularly "unusual" way that lions adapt their behavior to fit into a local ecosystem.

In Hwange National Park, rangers provide water for wildlife at artificially pumped waterholes during the dry season. These waterholes attract lots of prey species, as well as a few larger animals, like elephants, that lions don''t typically go after, Loveridge said in the blog post.

The Hwange lions not only include these rare water sources in their ranges, but they also have adapted to hunt the elephants that are drawn to these places, the researchers said. The lions only go after elephant calves, but even those animals are rather large compared to the lions'' typical prey. The predators'' tendency to attack baby elephants is related to the dryness of the season; lions are more likely to go after elephants when there is a shortage of water and the elephants must travel long distances to find it, Loveridge said.','','2015-08-12 16:27:09.923143','2015-08-12 16:27:09.923143');
INSERT INTO articles VALUES(8,'Alien of the Deep Has Needle-Sharp Teeth & a Shiny Head Lure','Lurking in the dark depths of the sea, a new species that looks more like an alien than a fish has been discovered, a creature with needlelike teeth and a glowing fishing pole of sorts atop its head.

Scientists spotted three females of the new species of anglerfish between 3,280 feet and nearly 5,000 feet (1,000 and 1,500 meters) beneath the Gulf of Mexico. The little fish, whose bodies ranged in length from 1.2 to 3.7 inches (30 to 95 millimeters), live under extreme conditions: No sunlight penetrates their deep habitats where they endure immense pressures of more than 2,200 pounds (1 ton) per square inch.

Now called Lasiognathus dinema, the anglerfish stood out from other species in its genus by the curved appendages jutting out from its so-called esca, or the organ at the tip of the "fishing rod" that contains light-producing bacteria. The species name dinema comes from the Greek words "di" for "two" and "nema" for "thread," referring to the threadlike extensions sprouting from the bases of the light organ''s hooks, the researchers, Tracey Sutton of Nova Southeastern University in Florida and Theodore Pietsch of the University of Washington, write in the journal Copeia (published by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists).

Anglerfish use this lure to reel in unsuspecting fish that mistake the light for a meal. 

The researchers aren''t sure whether or not Lasiognathus dinema can move its head rod at will, but it seems likely. "This particular group of anglerfishes has never been seen alive, but based on the musculature and anatomy, it looks like they have a great deal of control over the ''fishing rod,''" Sutton told Live Science.

The researchers found just females of this species but suspect the males would be smaller, as other anglerfish in the suborder Ceratioidei show extreme sexual dimorphism — females of the species Ceratias holboelli, for instance, can be some 60 times longer and a half million times heavier than the males.

The males in this group also often lack any lure and some fuse themselves to the female, living off of nutrients from her bloodstream, providing sperm to fertilize her eggs in return.  

"So far, we do not have any female specimens with males, but there are so few specimens of this group that are known, the best answer would be, ''We don''t know if the males attach themselves in this genus,''" Sutton said.

Like the newfound creature, most anglerfish are relatively small beasties — male Photocorynus spiniceps may be the world''s smallest vertebrate — but Sutton has seen one off Iceland spanning nearly 3 feet, he said.

The team found the haunting new species while out on the Gulf as part of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Process conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Lasiognathus dinema was found near the Macondo wellhead at depths where intrusions of hydrocarbons from the BP oil spill in 2010 were reported.','','2015-08-12 16:29:45.761247','2015-08-12 16:29:45.761247');
INSERT INTO articles VALUES(9,'New Jelly-Bean-Size ''Masked'' Frog Discovered in the Andes','A tiny new frog species discovered in the Peruvian Andes has a white-mottled belly and a dark face mask that makes it look like a bandit.

Noblella madreselva lives in the humid cloud forest near Cusco, Peru, probably only in the valleys right around where it was discovered, researchers report today (Aug. 6) in the journal ZooKeys. The frogs, which are not much bigger than jelly beans, can fit on the tip of a human finger. They''re active during the day, and live in leaf litter on the forest floor.

Vanessa Uscapi, a biologist at the National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cusco, Peru, discovered the new tiny frog in January 2011, but only now has it been officially described. She and her colleagues picked the name madreselva to honor conservation initiatives in the region: The word means "mother jungle" and is also the name of a nearby ecotourism lodge and a small valley where a group called Sircadia is trying to launch a sustainable eco-community.

N. madreselva has a dark-brown body with a darker patch on its head. Its belly is decorated with striking white marks. It''s not the only recently discovered tiny frog with bold coloration; in June, researchers in Brazil announced the discovery of seven itsy-bitsy new frogs from rainforests in Brazil. Those frogs, all of which belong to the genus Brachycephalus, came in colors ranging from greenish-brown to bright orange and blue.

The smallest frog ever discovered hails from Papua New Guinea, and could perch quite comfortably on a penny. Frogs, of the genus Paedophryne, are less than half an inch long. The smallest species in the genus, Paedophryne amauensis, grows to be just 0.3 inches (7.7 millimeters), on average. It''s not only the world''s smallest frog, but also the smallest vertebrate discovered so far.

The newly discovered Peruvian frog likely has a very limited geographical range, making it vulnerable to the effects of deforestation and habitat loss, Uscapi and her colleagues said. Andean frogs are also at risk of a deadly chytrid fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This fungus has devastated frog populations worldwide. It causes the amphibians'' skin to harden, disrupting their electrolyte balance and causing cardiac arrest. A December 2013 study in the journal Conservation Biology found that climate change in the Andes is increasing the area in which this fungus can thrive. Alessandro Catenazzi, one of the researchers on the team that discovered the new frog along with Uscapi, was an author of that 2013 study as well.

he researchers found that highlands frogs in the Andes were vulnerable to the fungus, while lowlands frogs were likely to suffer not from the fungus, but from warming temperatures.

"The frogs in the highlands will not suffer from climate change anytime soon, but they''re doomed because of the fungus, whereas the frogs in the lowlands are shielded from the fungus but they''re going to be toasted because it''s too hot," Catenazzi told Live Science at the time.','','2015-08-12 16:31:19.287140','2015-08-12 16:31:19.287140');
